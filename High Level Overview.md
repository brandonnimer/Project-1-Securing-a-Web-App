# Project-1-Securing-a-Web-App
The walkthrough and technical brief of my first project, Securing a Web Application through Azure.

We started the project by selecting either Azure or GoDaddy in order to set up a free Domain which we would later secure. The attached technical breif walks through the steps taken to create this blog, both on the front end design front as well as the back end security front.

This project acted as a way to familiarize myself with the Azure environment, as well as put my learning into practice by taking the necessary steps to ensure this Domain was secure and prevent future attacks from a basic level. Through this exercise I was able to secure a web application with an SSL certificate, create a front door, configure custom WAF rules, analyze and remediate security center recommendations, as well as gain an understanding of the practical usecase for why each step was important
